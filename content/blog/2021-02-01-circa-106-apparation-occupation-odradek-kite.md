My first encounter with the Odradek was by flipping through the pages of Borge's "Book of Imaginary Beings".

In the book, Borges adds the Kafka short story "The cares of a family man" in which Odradek is described.

By re-reading Kafka's story, I started annotating the materials the Odradek is ''supposely made of, in his description:



> At first glance it looks like a flat star-shaped spool for thread, and indeed it does seem to have thread wound upon it;

**thread, spool**

> \[...] to be sure, they are only old, broken-off bits of thread, knotted and tangled together, of the most varied sorts and colors.

**knotted and tangled together**

**sorts and colors**

> But it is not only a spool, for a small wooden crossbar sticks out of the middle of the star, and another small rod is joined to that at a right angle. By means of this latter rod on one side and one of the points of the star on the other

**wood, rod, sticks**



I started realizing that the Odradek has the same base materials as the kites I'm creating. Maybe is it a kite?

I spread my kites on the floor:

![](/img/img_20210201_120553106.jpg "kites on the floor #4")



As I started to get closer to the kites, I began to see the shapes of Odradek, with it's wooden rods and even the star shaped format.

I started to sketch an Odradek made of the kites.

> One is tempted to believe that the creature once had some sort of intelligible shape and is now only a broken-down remnant. Yet this does not seem to be the case; at least there is no sign of it; nowhere is there an unfinished or unbroken surface to suggest anything of the kind; the whole thing looks senseless enough, but in its own way perfectly finished.

A hand-made kite has the same properties. Looks senseless, broken down. But it's shapes are whole and finished. 

Odradek unhabits houses, as described by the "family man".

He comes and goes, and he imagines it is in other houses.

> He lurks by turns in the garret, the stairway, the lobbies, the entrance hall. Often for months on end he is not to be seen; then he has presumably moved into other houses; but he always comes faithfully back to our house again.

As Circa is an exibition space, but also a house, where people live in:

**I imagined a shape-shifted Odradek, made of broken kites, visiting Circa on this night.**

**or**

**I imagined a shape-shifted Kite, resembling an Odradek, visiting Circa on this night.**

**This sighting** would then be recorded and published on the website.

As a step further, I imagined a camera capturing the creature inside the house. And a screen outside, showing the Odradek's image inside Circa. So people on the street could see the creature.

Other sightings of this creature would then be added to the database, including when it's flying.

It is possible that this Odradek can fly.
