ANARCHITECTURE - 70sÂ 

movement from chile in NYC

global cities were still ruined in the 70s.

waiting for a kind of reconstruction.

**"Nothing works"** - *Gordon Matta-Clark*

you need nothing

you own nothing

you expect nothing

only then you can think the concept of freedom

we stopped in the having being owning.

**"No-thing"**

The dynamic of gentrification (we are doing it again).

"Need to destroy to build another thing"
