## Knowledge and Corporeality
The epistemologies of the South deal with knowledges present in or emerging
from the resistance to and the struggle against oppression, knowledges that are,
therefore, embodied in concrete bodies, whether collective or individual. This
embodied character of knowledge poses many challenges.
The epistemologies of the North are grounded in the idea of the rational subject, a subject that is epistemic rather than concrete or empirical. Kant, the author of the most
monumental treatise in the Western philosophy of subjectivity, underscores
emphatically this distinction when he writes, in the epigraph to The Critique
of Pure Reason, “de nobis sibi silemus” (about ourselves we say nothing). That
is to say, the separation of subject from object, rendered fundamental since
Descartes, is possible only on the condition that the only relevant subject is
the epistemic subject, not empirical ones. The latter must be silenced, not only
because they are subjected to the contamination of the object, but also because the German language), the ones conducting the struggles against oppression; they are themselves easily convertible into someone else’s objects.

According to the epistemologies of the South, embodied knowledge comes alive in living bodies (Leib and not Körper, to use an enlightening distinction in
they are the bodies that suffer with the defeats and rejoice with the victories.

Meaning makes things culturally specific and possibly unintelligible. Presence happens in a direct access to our senses, before meaning.Presence operates at the level of instinct and emotion. Presence and meaning are present in all cultures, but some cultures are dominated by one or the other. Modern western culture / epistemologies of the North > meaning-cultures.Non-western cultures > presence-cultures. In intercultural exchanges, presence helps creating a sense of commonality and immediate evidence.
