Immersive room

Records people's silhouettes and playback later.

* presence, memory of a space/room. we are all alone is our room. Can we meet without being in the same space?
* encounter, exchange. what happens when our bodies come together?
* what do people explore in this space?

Ghosts in the room.

your own silhouette interacts with the other bodies of the past.
how?

video masks. stories, textures? 

your own silhouette is a projection or it could be a real shadow? (from a lamp in the middle of the room, or from projectors itself).

White projections with black silhouettes?
Dark room with white silhouettes?

### Until 01/11/2020
* Decide from the many ideas, choose one and stick with it. - done

### Until 01/12/2020

#### Critical concept points:
* What to show when two bodies are on top of each other? What kind of content? What makes sense?
* Acoustics of the room
* How to exhibit? One person at the time? A personal experience.

#### Critical technical points: 
* Recording the depth data or record a video to playback later? 
* GPU video outputs. How many projectors? Room rize
